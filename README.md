# My Photography Website
I wanted to create a personal portfolio website to showcase my photography skills. I chose to use Vue.js, ESlinter, and Tailwind CSS as the front-end stack for this project. The main focus for this project was to have a convientent place to store my best photos for potential clients, showcase my full-stack technical skills, display some design experience with front-end websites, as well as have fun desigining a new personal project!
